# Simple-Snake-Game-
It's pretty simple snake game that i made using C++ without OOP 

Here some basic things that anyone who's gonna try should know 

Controls for the game are mentioned below :-
'w' for Up movement
's' for Down movement 
'a' for Left movement
'd' for Right movement 

Few Optional Customization :-

1. To change the pace of the game all anyone needs to do is change "Sleep(100);" function that is called on line 209 temper with numbers of 0 and see what happens.

2. Addtional Cheat is also included that can be fun with fast pace it basically let snake go through the walls and let it through from another side which is fun.

   How to unlock Cheat code.  
   Step 1: Comment out Line 168 and 169
   Step 2; Uncomment from 172 to 179 
   
   To Uncomment just remove '//' from the front of the line of code.
   To Comment out just Add '//' in the front of the line of code.

3. Few other things can be changed  like Map element basically the Map area but it might flicker even more.



It's not the best game to play but it was fun to build this project even if it's pretty common game it was great learning experience and it was really fun.
