# Simple-Snake-Game-
It's pretty simple snake game that i made using C++ without OOP 

Here some basic thing that anyone who's gonna play should know 

Control of for the game are mentioned below :-
'w' for Up movement
's' for Down movement 
'a' for Left movement
'd' for Right movement 

Few Optional Customization :-

1. To change the pace of the game all anyone needs to do is change "Sleep(100);" function that is called on line 209 temper with numbers of 0 and see what happens.

2. Addtional Cheat is also included that can be fun with fast pace it basically let snake go through the walls and let it through from another side which is fun.  

3. Few other things can be changed  like Map element basically the Map area but it might flicker even more.



It's not the best game to play but it was fun to build this project even if it's pretty common game it was great learning experience and it was really fun.
